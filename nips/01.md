Basic protocol flow description
-------------------------------

`draft` `mandatory`


1. Each user has a keypair. Signatures, public key and encodings are done according to the [Schnorr signatures standard for the curve `secp256k1`](https://bips.xyz/340).
2. The single object type that exists is the `event`, which has the following format on the wire:
    ```
    {
      id: <32-bytes sha256 of the the serialized event data>
      pubkey: <32-bytes hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
      created_at: <unix timestamp>,
      kind: <integer>,
      tags: [
        ["e", <32-bytes hex of the id of another event>, <recommended relay URL>],
        ["p", <32-bytes hex of the id of another event>, <recommended relay URL>],
        ... // other kinds of tags may be included later
      ]
      content: <arbitrary string>,
      sig: <64-bytes signature of the sha256 hash of the serialized event data, which is the same as the "id" field>,
    }
    ```
3. To obtain the `event.id`, we `sha256` the serialized event. The serialization is done over the UTF-8 JSON-serialized string (with no indentation or extra spaces) of the following structure:
    ```
    [
      0,
      <pubkey, as a hex string>,
      <created_at, as a number>,
      <kind, as a number>,
      <tags, as an array of arrays>,
      <content>, as a string
    ]
    ```
4. Users can connect to any compatible relay by opening a websocket connection to `<relay_url>/ws`. The websocket accepts the following messages, each of it should trigger a different action on their part:
  * `sub-key:<pubkey, as a hex string>`, subscribes to events from this key (a client will do this for every key it is "following"), it instructs the relay to send event messages for every new event it sees from this key;
  * `unsub-key:<pubkey, as a hex string>`, as above, but unsubscribes ("unfollow"), the opposite of the previous;
  * `req-feed:<{limit, offset}, object with these optional parameters>`, requests the latest events from the pubkeys subscribed to above (the basic flow is to open a websocket, call `sub-key` many times, then call `req-feed`), upon receiving this the relay should gather the latest events from all the keys this websocket client has subscribed to with `sub-key` and send them as event messages.
  * `req-event:<{id, limit}, object with the event id and optional parameters>`, requests one event specifically and other events related to it ("browse a thread").
  * `req-key:<{key, limit, offset}, object with the pubkey and optional parameters>`, requests one pubkey specifically ("browse a user profile").
  * `<event, in object format as noted above>`, publishes an event.
5. The websocket will emit two types of messages:
  * `[<event>, <context>]`, a JSON array containing an event object and the context in which it is being emitted. The `<context>` is a string with a single letter, which can be:
    * "p": Used with events the relay has requested with `req-feed`.
    * "n": Used when a new event is received by the relay and propagated to the client which has subscribed to it with `sub-key`.
    * "r": Used for events sent in response to `req-event` or `req-key`.
  * `["notice", <string>]`, a notice from the relay, either an error message or something else the relay wants to communicate.
6. There are 3 kinds of events can publish (other NIPs may define different types):
  - `0`: `set_metadata`: the `content` is set to a stringified JSON object `{name: <string>, about: <string>, picture: <url, string>}` describing the user who created the event. A relay may delete past `set_metadata` events once it gets a new one for the same pubkey.
  - `1`: `text_note`: the `content` is set to the text content of a note, anything the user wants to say.
  - `2`: `recommend_server`: the `content` is set to the URL (e.g., `https://somerelay.com`) of a relay the event creator wants to recommend to its followers.
7. A relay may choose to treat different message kinds differently (for example, instead of just returning the newest events for a given profile on `req-key` it can choose to always return the latest `set_metadata` event it has even if that is very old, so the client can always see a name and picture when browsing a profile), or apply any arbitrary filtering criteria it desires to the kinds of events it will accept.

### Notes:

- The `tags` array can store any kind of tag the message may be related to. This NIP defines `"p"` -- meaning "profile", which points to a pubkey of someone that is referred to in the event --, and `"e"` -- meaning "event", which points to the id of an event this event is quoting, replying to or referring to somehow.
- The `<recommended relay URL>` item present on the `"e"` and `"p"` tags is an optional (could be set to `""`) URL of a relay the client could attempt to connect to fetch the tagged event or other events from a tagged profile. It MAY be ignored, but it exists to increase censorship resistance and make the spread of relay addresses more seamless accross clients.
- If a message contains an @-prefixed readable name in the body of it -- for example, _"hello @bob and @carol"_ -- and then 2 or more `"p"` tags, the client MAY replace the text of "@bob" and "@carol" with links to the 2 `"p"` pubkeys, in the order they're found. Or it MAY just show the list of tags somewhere on the side of the note.
- If a message contains 2 or more `"e"` tags, the client MAY interpret it as being a message that belongs to the message thread initiated by the first `"e"` event, and a direct reply to the second `"e"` event.
