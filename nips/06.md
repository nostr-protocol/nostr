Basic key derivation from mnemonic seed phrase
----------------------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:fiatjaf`

[BIP39](https://bips.xyz/39) is used to generate mnemonic seed words and derive a binary seed from them.

[BIP32](https://bips.xyz/32) is used to derive the path `m/44'/1237'/0'/0/0` (according to the Nostr entry on [SLIP44](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md)).

This is the default for a basic, normal, single-key client.

Other types of clients can still get fancy and use other derivation paths for their own other purposes.
